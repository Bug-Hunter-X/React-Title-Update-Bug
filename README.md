# React Title Update Bug

This repository demonstrates a common React bug related to incorrect conditional logic within the `useEffect` hook. The component's title should update whenever the count changes, but due to a flawed condition, the update only occurs when the count exceeds 0.  This example highlights how seemingly small logic errors can lead to unexpected behavior.
